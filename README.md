# Defi-Empire-A-Simple-DeFI-Kingdom-Clone

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone repository! In this project, you'll find all the necessary resources to set up your very own decentralized finance (DeFi) empire, inspired by the popular DeFi Kingdom game. This README will guide you through the setup process and provide an overview of the project structure.

### Setting Up Your EVM Subnet on Avalanche

1. **Set up your EVM subnet**: Follow the provided guide and refer to the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.

2. **Define your native currency**: Customize your own native currency, which will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone. This currency will be pivotal in facilitating transactions within your decentralized ecosystem.

3. **Connect to Metamask**: Ensure seamless integration with Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide. This step is crucial for interacting with your EVM subnet and deploying smart contracts.

### Deploying Foundational Smart Contracts

1. **Deploy basic building blocks**: Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy essential smart contracts for your game. These contracts will establish the foundational components of your DeFi Kingdom clone, including functionalities for battling, exploring, and trading. Key aspects such as liquidity pools, tokens, and game rules will be defined within these contracts.

### Repository Structure

- **/contracts**: Contains Solidity smart contracts for various functionalities of the game.
- **/guides**: Provides step-by-step guides for setting up your EVM subnet, defining native currency, connecting to Metamask, and deploying smart contracts.
- **/docs**: Documentation related to the project, including API references, architecture overview, and developer guidelines.
- **/examples**: Sample code snippets and templates for reference during development.
- **/tests**: Test scripts and cases for ensuring the robustness and reliability of your smart contracts.
- **/scripts**: Scripts for automation, deployment, and other utilities.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions provided in the `/guides` directory to configure your EVM subnet, define native currency, and connect to Metamask.
3. Deploy the smart contracts located in the `/contracts` directory using Remix or your preferred development environment.
4. Explore the functionalities of your DeFi Kingdom clone and start building your empire!
